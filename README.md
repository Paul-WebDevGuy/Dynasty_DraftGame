# Dynasty_DraftGame
To build this app, I used the MERN stack (MongoDB, ExpressJS, React, and NodeJS).  MongoDB is where the data will be stored. ExpressJS is the framework to help build the app specifically the API's and routes connecting to the server. React is what I used to build the front-end and gather the data entered by users.  NodeJS was used so I could build the entire app in JavaScript.  NodeJS allows the app to be lightweight and efficient and it can be updated in real time as the draft unfolds.

This is a draft game that my friends and I play each year during the NFL draft.  We had been using a Google Forms template that was pretty clunky and was not very convenient.  This will allow users to enter 3 choices for each pick during round 1 of the draft.  A correct choice A is worth 5 points, choice B is worth 3, and choice C is worth 1.  The app will keep track of each users picks and then update a leaderboard as each pick from the draft is made.
